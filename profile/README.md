### Welcome to the Trivial Academy.
The Trivial Academy is a highly prestigious academic institution located in the deep depths of the magic world.

Our current projects include:
- [Trivial](https://github.com/Trivial-Academy-Headmasters/Trivial), a trivia-based game used throughout the school's activities.
- [Trivial Steps](https://github.com/Trivial-Academy-Headmasters/Trivial-Steps), a dance game, where the player takes the position of a student at the academy, dancing to progress through the year.

(The Trivial Academy is a fictional school, inspired by KONAMI's "Quiz Magic Academy" series.)
